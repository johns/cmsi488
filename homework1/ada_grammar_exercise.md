a. What can you say about the relative precedences of `and` and `or`?
>hi

b. If possible, give an AST for the expression `X and Y or Z`. (Assume, of course, that an Exp5 can lead to identifiers and numbers, etc.) If this is not possible, prove that it is not possible.
>hi

c. What are the associativities of the additive operators? The relational operators?
>hi

d. Is the `not` operator right associative? Why or why not?
>hi

e. Why do you think the negation operator was given a lower precedence than multiplication?
>hi

f. Give an abstract syntax tree for the expression `-8 * 5`.
>hi

g. Suppose the grammar were changed by dropping the negation from Exp2 and adding `- Exp5` to Exp4. Give the abstract syntax tree for the expression `-8 * 5` according to the new grammar.
>hi
